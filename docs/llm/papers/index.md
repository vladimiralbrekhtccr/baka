Excellent choices. Focusing on these two directions provides a very strong foundation for a novel research paper. Both ideas push the boundaries of either the MLLM architecture or its training methodology.

Here is the updated list of approved ideas, followed by a detailed discussion on the feasibility of using GRPO for the EARL framework.

### **Approved Research Directions**

#### **1. Cross-Layer Vision Refinement (CLVR)**

* **The Core Idea:** Create a feedback loop where the language model can iteratively "re-examine" the image to refine its understanding, moving beyond the standard one-way "fire-and-forget" vision projection.
* **The Problem It Solves:** Standard MLLMs project the image into a fixed set of embeddings once. This limits their ability to perform complex, multi-step visual reasoning that might require a second look or a change of focus on the image.
* **How It Works:** The LLM's hidden state from an intermediate layer is fed *back* to a small "Refinement Adapter." This adapter uses the LLM's current reasoning context as a query to re-attend to the original ViT features, producing a new, refined set of visual embeddings that are injected back into a later LLM layer.
* **Novelty:** This is a significant architectural innovation enabling a form of "visual active memory," where the LLM actively seeks and refines the visual information it needs.

#### **2. Expert-Aligned Reinforcement Learning (EARL)** 
>[!Note] Maybe with GRPO

* **The Core Idea:** Use reinforcement learning to not only train the model to produce the correct final answer but also to encourage it to use the "correct" internal reasoning pathways (i.e., activating the right experts for the right sub-tasks).
* **The Problem It Solves:** Standard fine-tuning is a weak signal for teaching complex reasoning and does not explicitly encourage MoE experts to specialize in a coherent, interpretable way.
* **How It Works:** After an initial fine-tuning phase where you identify which expert clusters are associated with certain skills (e.g., OCR, spatial reasoning), you use RL to continue training. You provide a bonus reward if the model uses the "correct" expert cluster to solve a corresponding sub-task, thereby reinforcing good internal reasoning habits.
* **Novelty:** It's a new training framework that goes beyond aligning outputs and begins to align the model's internal processes, potentially leading to more robust and interpretable models.
